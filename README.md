# Project-Writeups
This is a repository for any writeups I have done for various academic or extracurricular learning projects.
During my development and journey through my cybersecurity degree, I intend to understake various learning projects like TryHackMe, WebGoat, etc. so I can further my understanding of the concepts beyond just how to accomplish specific tasks. I've been familiar with many platforms from before I started my degree path, but I have been introduced to more through my coursework.
